# IPL-Analysis-Dashboard
In this project, I have designed a dashboard consisting of five objectives using the IPL analysis (2008-2020) dataset. 
The reason for choosing this IPL dataset is basically I love cricket. I used to see almost all IPL matches in live. While searching for the dataset, I came across many datasets but I felt this IPL topic was something interesting and unique. So, I chose this as my dataset.
I have listed all my five objectives below: - 

1)TOTAL NO. OF MATCHES PLAYED IN EACH CITY 

2)TOTAL NO. OF TOSSES WON BY TEAM W.R.T YEAR.

3)TOTAL NO. OF MATCH WON BY TEAM W.R.T YEAR.

4)MOST MAN OF THE MATCHES AWARD WON BY TOP 10 PLAYERS.

5)EVERY YEAR (MAXIMUM MARGIN RUNS) BY TOP 3 TEAMS.
