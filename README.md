# IPL-analysis
In this project, I have designed a dashboard consisting of six objectives using the IMDb movies analysis (2006-2016) dataset.

The reason for choosing this IMDb dataset is basically I am a movie buff. I used to see the movies which has a higher IMDb rating. While searching for the dataset, I came across many datasets but I felt this IMDb topic was something interesting and unique. So, I chose this as my dataset.

I have listed all my six objectives below: -

Top 5 revenue generated movies every year.
Count of different genre movies released every year.
Top 3 movies with highest running time every year.
Total sum of votes received for different genre every year.
Top 5 movies with highest metascore every year.
Top 3 highest rated IMDb movies every year.
SOURCE OF DATASET

Kaggle.com is one of the best websites for downloading datasets. I have downloaded IMDB dataset from 2006 to 2016 (A data set of 1,000 popular movies on IMDB in the last 10 years).
